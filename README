Add a clone() system call in proc.c. This system call is similar to fork(). Different from fork(), three main difference were made.
Address Space: The thread shares the same address space with parent.
File Descriptor: The thread uses the same file descriptor as parent.
User Stack: When return, the thread is running on this stack, instead of the stack of the parent.
The thread library is implemented in ulib.c. Add a thread_create() call, lock_acquire() and lock_release() functions. To implement the spin lock, first create a new data type in types.h to store the lock.
